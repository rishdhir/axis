# MediaPipe Face Landmark Detection

A real-time face landmark detection application built with React, TypeScript, and MediaPipe. This project serves as both a standalone application and a robust foundation for building more complex face-driven applications. Whether you're looking to implement basic facial tracking or create advanced face-driven experiences, this codebase provides the essential building blocks.

## Features

- 🎯 Real-time face detection and landmark tracking
- 🕸️ Face mesh visualization with customizable styles
- 📹 Webcam integration with permission handling
- 🔄 Automatic CDN availability checking
- ⚡ Built with performance in mind
- 🎨 Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS

## Technology Stack

- **React** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **MediaPipe** - ML-powered face detection and landmark tracking
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Vite** - Next-generation frontend tooling

## About MediaPipe

[MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) is Google's open-source framework for building multimodal (e.g. video, audio, etc.), cross platform (e.g. Android, iOS, web, edge devices) applied ML pipelines. This project specifically uses:

- **Face Mesh** - Estimates 468 3D face landmarks in real-time
- **Camera Utils** - Handles camera input and processing
- **Drawing Utils** - Provides utilities for rendering landmarks and connections

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mediapipe-face-landmark.git
   cd mediapipe-face-landmark
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

```

## How It Works

1. **Camera Access**: The application requests camera permission and initializes the webcam feed.

2. **Face Detection**: MediaPipe's Face Mesh model processes each video frame to detect faces.

3. **Landmark Detection**: For each detected face, 468 landmarks are identified.

4. **Visualization**: The landmarks and connections are rendered on a canvas overlay:
   - Face mesh tesselation (light gray)
   - Eyes and eyebrows (red/green)
   - Face oval (white)
   - Lips (pink)

5. **Real-time Updates**: The process continues in real-time, updating the visualization with each new video frame.

## Performance Considerations

- GPU acceleration when available
- Efficient canvas rendering
- Automatic resource cleanup
- CDN availability monitoring
- Error handling and recovery

## Building on This Project

This codebase is designed to be a springboard for more sophisticated face-driven applications. Here are some potential extensions:

<img src="./public/media/example.gif" alt="Example" width="800" />

- **3D Face Effects**: Use the detected landmarks to drive morph targets (blendshapes) on 3D character models
- **Face Filters**: Create Snapchat-style AR filters using the precise landmark data
- **Expression Recognition**: Analyze landmark positions to detect facial expressions
- **Virtual Try-On**: Build virtual makeup or accessory try-on experiences
- **Motion Capture**: Use facial movements to animate 3D characters in real-time
- **Interactive Art**: Create artistic visualizations that respond to facial movements
